# Exam 1 Practice

welcome! Your job is to complete all the function definitions mentioned in the three problem set files such that they meet the stated requirements:

- `problem_set_1.py`
- `problem_set_2.py`
- `problem_set_3.py`

To run the program, modify and run the file named [main.py](./main.py).

## Clone this repository

First, clone this repository to your local computer, using Visual Studio Code's cloning feature.

## Set up Visual Studio Code

Once cloned, set Visual Studio Code to be suitable for Python development using the "command palette":

- set the interpreter to a Python 3.x interpreter, such as that by [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/).
- set the linter to by `pylint`.
- set the test framework to be `pytest`.

### Run the program

To run the program, modify the file named `main.py` so that it calls whichever functions you want to execute from the other files where you have written code. Then run this `main.py` file. This file is meant to help you get your code in the other files working, and will not itself be graded.
