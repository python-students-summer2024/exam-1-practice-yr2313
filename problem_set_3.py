import random

##--------------------- Function #1 ---------------------##
# Define a function named 'get_random_int'.  
# This function accepts two arguments: a minimum value and a maximum value.
# The function must return a random integer between these two values, inclusive.
# Use the function random.randint() to generate the pseudo-random number.


##--------------------- Function #2 ---------------------##
# Define a function named 'get_guess'.
# This function accepts a single argument - an integer that serves as a max value.
# This function asks the user once to guess a random integer between 1 and the max value, inclusive.
# The function calls the function named get_random_int in order to generate the random integer in this range.
# If the user has entered an invalid response (i.e. anything that is not an integer in this range), the function returns an integer, -1.
# If the user has guessed the random integer correctly, this function returns a boolean True.
# If the user has guessed incorrectly, this function returns a boolean False.


##--------------------- Function #3 ---------------------##
# Define a function named 'play_game'.
# This function does not accept any arguments.
# This function uses the get_guess function to ask the user four times to guess a random integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.
# Each time the user guesses, they are immediately informed whether they guessed correctly or not, with the printed output, "Correct!" or "Wrong!"
# If at any time, the user enters an invalid response, the program immediately prints out the text, "Invalid response!" and does not print out anything further.
# At the end, the function, assuming the user has entered all valid guesses, the program prints out the percent of guesses that user guessed correctly, following the format: "You guessed 75% of the random numbers correctly."
